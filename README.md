# leaflet on webxdc

this little demonstration shows a map using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) in a [webxdc](https://webxdc.org) mini app.

the map needs `internet_access` to be enabled, which is currently requires the app to be used in "Saved Messages"
of a self-compiled delta chat (the feature is not yet releases anywhere).
